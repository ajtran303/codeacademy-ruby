# Symbols are usually used as hash keys or to reference method names
# They are immutable (can't change after creating)
# Only one copy exists at a time (saves memory)
# Thus symbol as keys are faster than strings as keys

symbol_hash = {
  :one => 1,
  :two => 2,    # Fill in these two blanks!
  :three => 3,
}
