# This program takes a user's string input and asks for words to redact from that input.
# The .split method will take a string and return an array. It can take a delimiter as an argument to define where to split the string.

What could you do to make sure your redactor redacts a word regardless of whether itâ€™s upper case or lower case?
How could you make your program take multiple, separate words to REDACT?
How might you make a new redacted string and save it as a variable, rather than just printing it to the console?
